# Pig-Game
A simple dice game where the objective is to reach a total point of 100 before the opponent.

Gameplay :
Choose a player to go first, this player will be "Player 1". The active player will roll the die continously until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold". Game ends when a player has reached 100 or more points.
 
Rules :
  - If a player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn
  - If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their current total and the player's turn continues
  - If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn
